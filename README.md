**Calvin Chen** is a recent graduate of the University of California, Berkeley where he studied Computer Science and Data Science. This summer, he worked at the Los Angeles Mayor’s Data Team analyzing the City's awarded procurement opportunities for the past 5 years and determined if there were inequitable trends between disadvantaged businesses, minority-owned businesses, and women-owned businesses versus businesses that were none of these categories. From building a pipeline from Salesforce to Tableau, his team determined that there was a great discrepancy between the awards granted by the City to these different business types by NAICS code, and listed several recommendations for how the City might combat these inequities for the future. | [Presentation](Calvin_Chen.pdf)

**Carolyn Wang** is a rising sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley studying Computer Science and Political Economy. This summer, she worked as a software engineering Corps member at the City of Boston's Department of Innovation and Technology.

This data story explored how equitable job placements were around New York City. | [Presentation](Hunter_Thompson.pdf)

**Irene Tang** is a graduate student at the University of Chicago studying Linguistics. This summer, she worked with the Los Angeles Mayor’s Data team. Following the City’s 2021 migration of procurement data into a Salesforce database, her team assessed the City’s social equitability in choosing business partners--the first attempt to do so in over 20 years! Critically, they found that disadvantaged-owned, minority-owned, and women-owned enterprises tended to win lower-value contracts. They also found that the City contracts with a lot of businesses headquartered outside LA County (and even outside California) -- but this was justified because for many industries in which the City needs work done, there were not enough local businesses that specialize in that industry. | [Presentation](Irene_Tang.pdf)

**Ivy Li** is a recent graduate of Yale University where she studied Architecture (Design). This summer, she worked at the Utah Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget designing a completely new performance measures portal used by the Utah government and soon to be open to the public.

**Joey Headley** is a recent graduate of Williams College where he studied Physics. This summer, he worked on a project with the City of Boston’s Citywide Analytics Team which involved replicating the logic and functionality of a web app made for the City of Boston called the RentSmart App into a Tableau dashboard. The purpose of the RentSmart dashboard is to enable users to search for any residential property in Boston available to rent and display all the violations associated with that property within the past 3 years. Over the course of his project he leveraged PostgreSQL to format the data into a form suitable for Tableau data analysis and carried out multiple forms of data visualization and analysis in Tableau to create the new dashboard. | [Presentation](Joey_Headley.pdf)

**Silky Agrawal** is a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy studying Computational Analysis and Public Policy. This summer, she worked with the City of Boston’s Citywide Analytics Team. The City of Boston recognizes the importance of data quality checks for its datasets published for public use. Any non-standard and unautomated checks lead to delayed knowledge of such data quality issues amongst stakeholders. Therefore, the team wanted to have an automated data quality check process embedded in their workflow which would directly inform stakeholders of data quality issues, if any and take immediate corrective measures before the data is released to the public. Silky worked on creating a pipeline that helped automate data quality checks for one of the datasets for the Department of Inspection Services. | [Presentation](Silky_Agrawal.pdf)
