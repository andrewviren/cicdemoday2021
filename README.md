**Calvin Chen** is a recent graduate of the University of California, Berkeley where he studied Computer Science and Data Science. This summer, he worked at the Los Angeles Mayor’s Data Team analyzing the City's awarded procurement opportunities for the past 5 years and determined if there were inequitable trends between disadvantaged businesses, minority-owned businesses, and women-owned businesses versus businesses that were none of these categories. From building a pipeline from Salesforce to Tableau, his team determined that there was a great discrepancy between the awards granted by the City to these different business types by NAICS code, and listed several recommendations for how the City might combat these inequities for the future.

**Carolyn Wang** is a rising sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley studying Computer Science and Political Economy. This summer, she worked as a software engineering Corps member at the City of Boston's Department of Innovation and Technology.

Particularly, using the text of each requests' description, he used Natural Language Processing to categorize each case into a topic that could easily be streamlined into a department.

**Hunter Thompson** is a recent graduate of the University of Chicago where he studied Computer Science. This summer, he worked at the New York City Mayor’s Office of Economic Opportunity utilizing workforce data for New York City to create a data story for the about to be released workforce data portal. This data story explored how equitable job placements were around New York City.

**Irene Tang** is a graduate student at the University of Chicago studying Linguistics. This summer, she worked with the Los Angeles Mayor’s Data team. Following the City’s 2021 migration of procurement data into a Salesforce database, her team assessed the City’s social equitability in choosing business partners--the first attempt to do so in over 20 years! Critically, they found that disadvantaged-owned, minority-owned, and women-owned enterprises tended to win lower-value contracts. They also found that the City contracts with a lot of businesses headquartered outside LA County (and even outside California) -- but this was justified because for many industries in which the City needs work done, there were not enough local businesses that specialize in that industry.

**Ivy Li** is a recent graduate of Yale University where she studied Architecture (Design). This summer, she worked at the Utah Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget designing a completely new performance measures portal used by the Utah government and soon to be open to the public.

**Jorge Gabitto** is a recent graduate of Code the Dream Bootcamp where he studied Full Stack development. This summer, he worked at the City of Austin's Data & Technology Services, Austin Transportation. He worked on migrating the department’s website from create react app to Next.js. Next.js is a React framework that allows react pages to be rendered server side which allows for better performance, load times, and improvements in SEO.

**Joey Headley** is a recent graduate of Williams College where he studied Physics. This summer, he worked on a project with the City of Boston’s Citywide Analytics Team which involved replicating the logic and functionality of a web app made for the City of Boston called the RentSmart App into a Tableau dashboard. The purpose of the RentSmart dashboard is to enable users to search for any residential property in Boston available to rent and display all the violations associated with that property within the past 3 years. Over the course of his project he leveraged PostgreSQL to format the data into a form suitable for Tableau data analysis and carried out multiple forms of data visualization and analysis in Tableau to create the new dashboard.

**Juliyen Davis** is a graduate student at Parsons School of Design studying Transdisciplinary Design.

As of August 2021, the preliminary evaluation of the allocation of ERAP funds, designed a framework for understanding who accessed the application to apply for rental assistance, and identify neighborhoods where ERAP relief was still needed.

**Renoj Varghese** is a recent graduate of the University of Connecticut where he studied Digital Media & Design. 

**Rudransh Dikshit** is a rising junior at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science. This summer, he worked as a software engineering Corps member at the New York City Department of City Planning’s Urban Design Office to design a REST-API to track sun position data and helped design an algorithm to calculate the roof pitch of buildings in New York and assess for solar potential.

**Silky Agrawal** is a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy studying Computational Analysis and Public Policy. This summer, she worked with the City of Boston’s Citywide Analytics Team. The City of Boston recognizes the importance of data quality checks for its datasets published for public use. Any non-standard and unautomated checks lead to delayed knowledge of such data quality issues amongst stakeholders. Therefore, the team wanted to have an automated data quality check process embedded in their workflow which would directly inform stakeholders of data quality issues, if any and take immediate corrective measures before the data is released to the public. Silky worked on creating a pipeline that helped automate data quality checks for one of the datasets for the Department of Inspection Services.

**Spencer Simon** is a graduate student at the University of Chicago studying Data Analytics. This summer, he worked at the New York City Department of City Planning’s Data Engineering Team on improving data access and usability using Google Cloud Platform to build out an enhanced data ecosystem for the agency. He demonstrated this enhanced data ecosystem in action by analyzing the impact of zoning changes on the built environment in New York City.

**Starasia Wright** is a recent graduate from CUNY Hunter College with a double Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and English with a Linguistics and Rhetoric Concentration. This summer, she worked at the Utah Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget creating and populating the database for a new performance measures portal used by the Utah government.

**Yoseph Ghazal** is a rising senior at the University of California, Irvine studying Computer Science.
